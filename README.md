# CheeseCakeGaming-Group-Project
Repository for my team's grade 11 CS project.
As a team of 3 people, we decided to try and create our own Visual Novel game for our project using the Python based engine Ren'Py.

# Fated To Bloom - About the Game
This game follows the story of a boy in highschool, living with his mildly abusive aunt and uncle. His parents and younger sister are gone, and the only light in his life is his best friend.
As the game progresses, he notices his teachers begin acting strange, coincidentally around the same time a murder is reported in the other side of town.

Visual Novels are story based games with multiple different paths and endings, all based on the player's decisions made throughout the game.

This was our first time attempting a project like this, so the game's playtime is definitely much shorter than any professional studio's work. Still, we made the story and plot as interesting and captivating as possible for the player.
